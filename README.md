# Apnea1DCNN
Hi!
These are several snippets codes which I've used in this project. 
My final project was to classify Apnea events from Non-Apnea Events based on ECG Signal recordings published by PhysioNET as a part of Computer in Cardiology Challenge 
(CinC 2000). 

One Dimensinal Convolutional Neural Network (1DCNN) was used to classify Apnea and Non-Apnea Events.

Data Preprocessing techniques used includes: 
Normalization (MinMaxScaler), Signal Filtering with IIR Notch Filter and BPF with fc=0.5Hz and Empyrical Mode Decomposition (EMD).

For further explanation, please refer to the .PDF file of my final project report written in Indonesia.
